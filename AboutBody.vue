		<span id = "about-text"><p>Hello! My name is Arman Madani, I am a graduate from UC Berkeley and a data enthusiast. While at Cal, I studied Economics and Data Science. I was a Business Development Analyst for the FinTech startup Affirm, as well as a Data & Analytics Consultant for an economic and litigation consulting firm called FTI Consulting. I'm currently a Data Science Fellow with Delta Analytics. In my spare time I enjoy traveling, playing basketball and tennis, gaming, reading, and messing around with datasets.</p>
		<p>While this blog is supposed to be about data science, policy, and economics, I know I'm going to go off on tangential topics and incorporate guest writers. So, it's really about anything I think you'll find remotely interesting.</p>
